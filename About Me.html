<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr>
<p>I am a dynamic and motivated freelance web developer with a solid foundation in building engaging web experiences using HTML and CSS. My journey includes a diverse year of freelancing where I honed my skills in web design, content creation, and crafting visuals with Canva. A recent graduate of the Fullstack Development program at Fnb App Academy, I am passionate about merging technical skill with creativity. I am a proactive learner, constantly expanding my skill set, and I thrive on bringing top-notch time management, clear communication, and adaptability to any project or team. When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me at the gym, reading, or on the football field, activities that fuel my energy and creative thinking. </p>
